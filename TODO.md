# TODO (Analytics + Growth Stuff)

- Add global counters on dashboard: total comments replied, total DMs sent.
- Show per-automation stats: comments replied, DMs sent, engagement %.
- Replace fake chart data with real activity data (comments/DMs per day).
- Add followers growth chart (followers per day).
- Add simple goal tracker (weekly DM / engagement goals + progress bar).
- Compute “best times to post” from post time + first-24h engagement.
- Add AI growth tips card that reads metrics + goals and spits 1–3 tips.
